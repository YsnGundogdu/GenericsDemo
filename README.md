# GenericsDemo

In this project, when a new element is added to an array with a certain element, I have defined a class with the name MyDictionary to make this array more dynamic. When a new element is added to the array in this class, it reserves a space for a new element without deleting the other elements of that array. For example, we defined the strings that keep the student number and the name of that student, and then we have successfully printed it on the console screen.
